## **Ongoing Research | Deep Learning based Diabetic Retinopathy Detection from Fundus Photographs**
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a debilitating eye disease caused by elevated blood glucose levels, which can lead to blindness if left
untreated. The diagnosis of DR is traditionally performed by skilled professionals but is time-consuming and prone to error.
This study leveraged the use of machine learning to evaluate medical images, with a focus on deep learning techniques applied
to retinal fundus images. The EyePACS dataset was used, which consists of high-resolution images in five classes, taken under
various imaging conditions and dimensions. Customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were developed for the
classification task, including the use of EfficientNet (B0, B1), ResNet (18, 34, 101, 152), and Vision Transformer (ViT16). The
study introduced two new architectures, RevampResNet18V2 and ResManNet10, which achieved improved accuracy (89% and
86% test F1 score) with efficient computational requirements (894 and 862 million FLOPS respectively).
